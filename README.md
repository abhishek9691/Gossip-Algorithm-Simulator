# Gossip-Algorithm-Simulator

An implementation of Gossip based aggregation across nodes found in a network. The tasks and data aggregated were to find the minimum value at each node, maximum value, compute the average of all the values across the nodes, updated the contents in a fragment of the data at a specific node to reflect any changes made to another copy, and to retrieve data from other nodes to maintain up to date information. 2 network types were studied, a ring network and a mesg network. Each node then contained some data from a file with multiple floating point numbers in it. The gossip algorithm was implemented and repeated until convergence across all values within a threshold was achieved.
